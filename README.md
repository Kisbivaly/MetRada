# MetRada

## Overview

**MetRada** is a Python application designed to automatically update your Windows desktop background with the latest radar image from the Hungarian Meteorological Service's website. The application fetches the radar image every 10 minutes and updates the wallpaper accordingly. It uses UTC time to ensure that the correct image is retrieved based on a predefined schedule.

## Features

- **Automatic Updates**: Fetches and sets the radar image as the desktop wallpaper every 10 minutes.
- **UTC Time Handling**: Uses UTC time to ensure the correct image is retrieved.
- **Simple File Management**: Automatically saves and overwrites the image in a dedicated folder.
- **Windows Compatibility**: Designed specifically for Windows environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `requests` library
- `ctypes` library (included with Python standard library)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kisbivaly/MetRada.git
   cd MetRada

    Install Required Packages
    requests

2. **Install the required dependencies using:**

   ```bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Configure the Application

    The script saves images in a k√©pek folder located in the script's directory. Ensure that this folder is available or adjust the script configuration as needed.
   ```
### Usage

    Run the Script

    To start the background image updater, execute the script:

   ```bash

      python MetRada.py
   ```
The script will continuously fetch and update the desktop wallpaper with the latest radar image every 10 minutes.

Create an Executable (Optional)

If you prefer to run the application as a standalone executable, you can use PyInstaller:

   ```bash

    pip install pyinstaller
    pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole MetRada.py
   ```
    This will generate an executable file in the dist directory, which you can run directly.

### Code Explanation

    get_latest_image_url(): Calculates the URL for the radar image based on the current UTC time, rounded to the nearest 10 minutes.
    download_image(url, save_path): Downloads the radar image from the specified URL and saves it to the given path.
    set_background_image(image_path): Sets the downloaded image as the desktop wallpaper using Windows API calls.
    main(): Main loop that periodically downloads the latest radar image and updates the wallpaper.
